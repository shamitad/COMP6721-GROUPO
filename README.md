# Classification of Satellite Images and Aerial Data using CNN Models


This project focuses on the critical role of satellite imagery in urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
field surveys. Satellite data, particularly spatial
information, is essential for extracting and analyzing
insights that support informed decisions. To enhance
understanding of image classification, this project
compares the performance of three advanced convolutional
neural network (CNN) architectures: ResNet18,
AlexNet and MobileNetV2 to determine the most
effective model for classifying satellite images accurately
and efficiently.

Data from EuroSAT, RSI-CB, and RESICSC45
are considered to perform satellite image classification.
EuroSAT contains 27,000 labeled satellite images from 10
different land use and land cover categories such as forest,
highway, industrial, residential, and others and can be
downloaded from Kaggle. RESISC45 is a publicly
available benchmark for remote sensing image scene
classification that can be downloaded from TensorFlow. It
contains 31,500 images across 45 classes with 700 images
in each class. RSI-CB is also used for large-scale remote sensing image classification. It contains 7 classes and
around 45 subclasses under each class. For a more diverse
number of classes over the datasets that are being used in
the project, only 5 of the major classes are considered,
making the total dataset to be of 22,000 images over.
